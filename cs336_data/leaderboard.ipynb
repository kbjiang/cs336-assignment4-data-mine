    "\n",
    "**1. Batch Processing for ML Models** (Batch size: 64)\n",
    "- Language identification, NSFW, and toxicity models now process texts in batches via `filter_batch()`\n",
    "- Reduces model invocation overhead by ~64x compared to individual calls\n",
    "- Uses `model.predict(batch)` to leverage vectorized operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Incremental File Writing**\n",
    "- Write filtered content to JSONL as each batch completes\n",
    "- Reduces memory footprint (no buffering all content in memory)\n",
    "- Starts I/O earlier for better throughput\n",
    "- Opens file once and writes progressively\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Optimized Filter Ordering**\n",
    "- **Cheap filters first:** record type → URL (fast, rule-based)\n",
    "- **Expensive ML models last:** language → quality → NSFW → toxic (batched)\n",
    "    - quality has to be on English therefore go after language\n",
    "- Early filtering reduces number of texts sent to expensive ML models\n",
    "- Cascading batch filters: lang batch → nsfw batch → toxic batch → kept\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Parallel Processing with ProcessPoolExecutor**\n",
    "- 16 workers (`concurrent.futures`) process WET files independently\n",
    "- Each worker runs complete pipeline on one file\n",
    "- Single progress bar tracks overall completion\n",
    "- Automatic work distribution as workers finish tasks"
